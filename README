The media archive is intended to be a long term storage and query system for media files.
It is mainly intended for camera files, computer generated images, audio files and video
files. By tagging the data with key-value pairs in a relational database and using a
Wireshark like search filter data can be found very precisely.

Before uploading files the user needs to tag the data in a consistent way. The tool will
also help sorting out duplicates and allow the inclusion of additional meta data. EXIF
information will be included by default.

Media Transcoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Image
 - JPG, HEIC and PNG handled differently. Mainly to support EXIF data and very large PNG files and
   since PNG is used for early presentation
 - Fallback to Image Magic that converts image to 24bit PNG and then follows the normal flow
Image Sequence
 - GIF. If just a frame, convert to PNG via ffMPEG. Otherwise keep GIF format (loopable animation)
Audio
 - Any format converted to WAV via sox. Then visualized using Libsndfile and LibCairo and converted
   to x265 video with AAC as audio format using ffMPEG. The visualization will cover elapsed time,
   an overview waveform with progress line as well as a big horizontal line that will bounce as audio
   is being played. Some slow color coding may be used and possible a picture of the album/title.
   The output is rendered in 4k, 2k and 1k in 16:9 format.
Video
 - Any format converted to x265 with ffMPEG and stored in its original aspect ratio.

All media files will get thumbnail files in various sizes and quality. Then based on what's
available (up to) 1k, 2k, 4k files are generated. If 4:3 letterbox thumbnails have been generated
then a separate high res download file is available without the letterbox. Then for archive
purposes the original file is saved.

All output files are prefixed with the SHA1 sum of the original data. The original file only
has the SHA1 name as file name.
