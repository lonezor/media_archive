Search content based on tags. An exact string match of tags modelled with one or multiple levels of information.

By default the system includes all available info such as timestamps and EXIF. But the user then needs to tag it for
better search results. Tags can be changed at any time during the life cycle of an object, but mainly before initial
upload.

New tags can be added. Old tags are made visible to make it easier to find them. Some tags are predefined such as
country, continents etc.

Tags are stored in database in tag table and associated with the sha1 sum of each object. They are stored as key-value
value pair but when not relevant N/A is used internally (e.g. 'location.country' = 'United Kingdom" and 'animal' = 'N/A')

Query language with same syntax as Wireshark:

time.month 8
time.day 22
time.weekday Tuesday
time.date (2017-08-22)
time.epoch
